# Getting and Cleaning Data 
This folder is for the coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 
## Run_analysis.R code follows the steps listed below:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## Two tidy datasets are generated by run_analysis.R
1. Datafinal is got by merging text, train and feature data sets together. 
2. Data_tidy.txt is generated from step 5, which includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
